# Think Critically!

Review the image and answer the questions provided. Use context clues to make inferences. 

There’s no real "right" or "wrong" answer here as this challenge is just to get your brain thinking and looking deeper. When you make a claim about the image, think about what evidence you see here that brought you to that observation. If you’re having trouble, try mentally segmenting the image into sections and looking closely at just one section at a time.
