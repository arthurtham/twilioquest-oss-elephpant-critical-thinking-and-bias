# Think Critically!

In order to unlock the gates to the next area, you must solve at least three fallacy challenges listed on the chalkboards in this room and the room to the left.

Each station is represented by a chaklboard. Press the **spacebar** near them to interact with the station. Answer the multiple choice question correctly to succesfully complete the challenge at the station.

Remember: there are five boards in the gallery. After completing at least three logical fallacy stations, come back here to unlock the gallery's exit gate.
