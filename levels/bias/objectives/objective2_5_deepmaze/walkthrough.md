# Think Critically!

In order to unlock the gates to the next area, you must solve at least three deepening understanding challenges listed on the stations on the cryo bridge.

Each station is represented by a computer terminal. Press the **spacebar** near them to interact with the station. Answer the multiple choice question correctly to succesfully complete the challenge at the station.

Remember: there are five stations in the gallery. After completing at least three deepening understanding stations, come back here to unlock the gallery's exit gate.
