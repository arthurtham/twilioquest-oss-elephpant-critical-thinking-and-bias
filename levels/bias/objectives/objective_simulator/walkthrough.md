# Think Critically!

In order to show full understanding of the topic of biases, you must pass the **Bias Simulator challenge**.

There are terminals around the room that are connected to the pipes linked to this simulator. Each terminal represents a team member that you can add to your team. After adding at least three team members to your team, come back to this simulator and press "HACK" to run the Bias Simulator!
