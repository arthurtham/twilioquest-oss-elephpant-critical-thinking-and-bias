In other videos leading up to this point you may remember hearing about Harvard’s Implicit Bias Test (IAT) to evaluate people’s implicit bias. Project Implicit was founded in 1998 by three scientists – Dr. Tony Greenwald (University of Washington), Dr. Mahzarin Banaji (Harvard University), and Dr. Brian Nosek (University of Virginia). 

In this objective, you will take the IAT (the results are confidential and only you see them) and come back here to reflect on your results. Learn more about the IAT here: https://www.projectimplicit.net/resources/about-the-iat/

Pick 2-3 IAT categories and before taking it,  predict the outcomes you anticipate. Take the IAT in those categories
