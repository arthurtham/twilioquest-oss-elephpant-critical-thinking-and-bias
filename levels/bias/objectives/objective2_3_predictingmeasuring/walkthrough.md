# Think Critically!

The IAT can be taken more than once and for many different biases. If you feel you made a mistake in the execution of the test, just take it again. If you need more information on how the test works see their website here:

There is no real right or wrong answer here. However, taking this diagnostic can sometimes make people a bit defensive or worried. Identifying your bias does not mean you are now labeled as a ‘bad person’ and nobody can see your results. As we have learned this far, if we have a brain then we have a bias. Identifying them is the first step to combating them in daily life.
